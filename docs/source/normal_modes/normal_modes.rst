Normal and Phonon Modes
=====

A simple explanation of:
    - what normal and phonon modes are
    - how to compute them
    - how to "project" a Molecular Dynamics trajectory onto these modes.

We will first give a mathematical derivation of the normal modes of a molecule.
Later on, we will extend this concept to phonon modes of a crystal with a minimal effort.
