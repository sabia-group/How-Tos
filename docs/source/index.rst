Welcome to the SabIA Group How-To Examples

In this webpage, you will find a collection of "How-To" explanations compiled
by the SabIA group from 2024 onwards. We hope this is useful!

The Simulations from Ab Initio Approaches (SabIA) group is hosted at the
MPI for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter in Hamburg, Germany. Check
out our webpage too, under `this link`_.

Contributions come from all members of the group.
