This is a nice reStructuredText template. Let us start building this up.
Examples on how to write this can be found in this `rst primer <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_

Links are like this: `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_

You can also access the project GitHub repository here: `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/sabia-group/How-Tos/tree/main>`_

Highlighting text is *simple* and *intuitive* and **so on**.

These are links :doc:`usage` and :ref:`installation`.
